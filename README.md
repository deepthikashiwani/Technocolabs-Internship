# Mini Project 1 
<b>Data Analysis on Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing Dataset</b><br>

**Project Description**<br>
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
In this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected.

**Project Tasks**<br>
  **1**.Meet Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis<br>
  **2**.The alarming number of deaths<br>
  **3**.Death at the clinics<br>
  **4**.The handwashing begins<br>
  **5**.The effect of handwashing<br>
  **6**.The effect of handwashing highlighted<br>
  **7**.More handwashing, fewer deaths?<br>
  **8**.A Bootstrap analysis of Semmelweis hand washing data<br>
  **9**.The fate of Dr. Semmelweis<br>

# Mini Project 2
<b>Data Analysis on Default Credit Card clients Dataset</b><br>

**Project Description**<br>
Our client is a credit card company. They have brought us a dataset that includes some demographics and recent financial data (the past six months) for a sample of 30,000 of their account holders. This data is at the credit account level; in other words, there is one row for each account (you should always clarify what the definition of a row is, in a dataset). Rows are labeled by whether in the next month after the six month historical data period, an account owner has defaulted, or in other words, failed to make the minimum payment.

**Project Tasks**<br>
 **1**.Data Exploration and Cleaning<br>
 **2**.Exploring Remaining Financial Features in the dataset<br>
 **3**.Performing Logistic Regression with a New Feature and Creating a Precision-Recall Curve<br>
 **4**.Fitting a Logistic Regression Model and Directly Using the Coefficients<br>
 **5**.Cross-Validation and Feature Engineering with the Case Study Data<br>
 **6**.Cross-Validation Grid Search with Random Forest<br>
 **7**Deriving Financial Insights<br>
